# Object-Oriented Programming (Java)

Welcome to the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) repository! This repository contains Java projects completed during the Computer Science courses at the University of Johannesburg. The projects demonstrate various principles of Object-Oriented Programming and Java development.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized into several subfolders, each corresponding to different stages of learning and project development:

### 1. **Java Development Kit (JDK) and Basic Java**

This folder contains projects that introduce basic Java concepts and utilize the Java Development Kit (JDK). Projects may include:

- Fundamental Java programming concepts
- Basic syntax and data types
- Simple applications using JDK tools

### 2. **Problem Analysis and Model Classes**

Projects in this folder focus on problem analysis and the creation of model classes. You will find:

- Problem decomposition and analysis
- Design and implementation of model classes
- Examples of applying object-oriented principles to real-world problems

### 3. **Text IO and Regular Expressions**

This subfolder includes projects that explore text input/output (IO) and regular expressions in Java. It covers:

- File reading and writing
- Text parsing and manipulation
- Using regular expressions for pattern matching

### 4. **Advanced Object Orientation 2**

Here youâ€™ll find projects that delve into advanced object-oriented concepts. Topics may include:

- Inheritance and polymorphism
- Abstract classes and interfaces
- Advanced design patterns

### 5. **Introduce Generics and Binary I/O 2**

This folder contains projects that introduce generics and binary input/output (I/O). Key areas covered include:

- Java generics and type safety
- Handling binary data streams
- Practical applications of generics and binary I/O

### 6. **Advanced OO, JavaFX GUI, and Visitor Design Pattern**

Projects in this folder combine advanced object-oriented concepts with JavaFX GUI development and the Visitor Design Pattern. It includes:

- Developing GUIs with JavaFX
- Implementing design patterns for extensibility and maintainability
- Combining OOP principles with modern GUI techniques

### 7. **Enhancing FireworkDisplay with Particle Systems and JavaFX GUI**

The latest projects focus on enhancing the FireworkDisplay application with particle systems and advanced JavaFX GUI features. Projects include:

- Integrating particle systems for dynamic effects
- Using JavaFX for modern GUI enhancements
- Implementing animation and simulation features

## Getting Started

To get started with the projects in this repository:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Relevant Folder:**
   Change into the directory of the project you are interested in:
   ```bash
   cd Object-Oriented-Programming/Java-Development-Kit-and-Basic-Java
   # or
   cd Object-Oriented-Programming/Problem-Analysis-and-Model-Classes
   # and so on
   ```

3. **Compile and Run:**
   Each project folder includes a `README.md` file with specific instructions on how to compile and run the code. Follow those instructions to execute the projects.

## Example Project

### Advanced OO, JavaFX GUI, and Visitor Design Pattern Example

- **Description:** Implements a GUI application using JavaFX and advanced OOP principles. The project demonstrates the use of the Visitor Design Pattern for drawing different types of fireworks in a graphical display.
- **Files:**
    - `FireworkDisplayCanvas.java`: Contains the implementation of the canvas for displaying fireworks.
    - `FireworkDisplayPane.java`: Manages the layout and controls of the FireworkDisplay.
    - `README.md`: Provides instructions for compiling and running the project.
